This is a website is BuscaRamos, the platform for exploring courses and resources at the UC University.

It is built using Astro and Tailwind CSS v4. The website is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing an intuitive interface for users to navigate through various academic offerings.

Accesibility is a key focus, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can easily access and interact with the content. The website adheres to best practices in web development, ensuring compatibility across different devices and browsers.

All of our development is mobile-first, meaning that the design and functionality are optimized for mobile devices first, then scaled up for larger screens. For this we use our custom Tailwind Breakpoints `tablet:` and `desktop:`.
